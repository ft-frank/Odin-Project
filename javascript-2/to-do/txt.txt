Your code shows solid fundamentals for a beginner! Here's my honest take:
What you're doing well:

Good OOP structure - Using classes for Item and Project makes sense
Separation of concerns - Having a Page module to handle DOM operations is smart
Form validation - Checking for duplicate project names shows good attention to detail
localStorage persistence - Attempting to save data shows you're thinking beyond the basics

Areas that could be improved:
1. The code is getting long because you're mixing concerns
Your view() methods are doing a LOT of manual DOM manipulation. This is normal for vanilla JS, but it gets verbose. Compare this pattern you're using everywhere:
javascriptconst div = document.createElement('div')
const item = document.createElement('button')
item.classList.add('collapsible-item')
item.textContent = `${this.title}`
// ... 20+ more lines
2. Event listeners are being duplicated
Every time you call loadPage(), you're adding NEW event listeners without removing old ones:
javascriptfunction loadSelectProject() {
    selectForm.addEventListener('change', ...) // Gets added multiple times!
}
This causes memory leaks and bugs. You should either:

Add listeners once in initialise()
Or remove old listeners before adding new ones

3. The view() method does too much
Your Item.view() creates the DOM and adds event listeners and handles deletion logic. Better to separate these:
javascriptview() {
    // Just create and return DOM
}

attachEventListeners(element) {
    // Handle events separately
}
4. Finding projects repeatedly is inefficient
javascriptconst currentProject = Project.listOfProjects.find((project) => project.title === Project.currentProject)
You do this search many times. Instead, currentProject could be the actual Project object, not just a string.
Is it too long?
For vanilla JavaScript, ~200 lines is reasonable for a todo app. But you could make it more maintainable:

Extract repeated DOM creation into helper functions
Use a template or HTML string instead of createElement everywhere
Consider a simple framework like React or Vue for your next project (they solve these exact problems)

Overall verdict: This is good beginner code. You understand classes, DOM manipulation, and data persistence. The length isn't the problem - it's that some patterns are making it longer than needed. Keep building! Your next project will be cleaner. 👍
